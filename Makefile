define USAGE
Building packages:

    repo            Build the repository and reuse archives from the remote
                    repository for existing package versions.
    repo-local      Build the repository without using existing archives from
                    the remote repository.
    repo-new        Build only the new packages in the repository based
										on what exists in the remote repository
                    the remote repository.
    RECIPE          Build packages from the given recipe.
    RECIPE-push     Push built packages from the given recipe to the
                    .cache/opkg directory on the reMarkable.

Checking for errors:

    repo-check      Compare the local repository to the remote one.
    format          Check that the source code formatting follows
                    the style guide.
    format-fix      Automatically reformat the source code to follow
                    the style guide.
    lint            Perform static analysis on the source code to find
                    erroneous constructs.

Housekeeping:

    RECIPE-clean    Remove build artifacts from a given recipe.
    clean           Remove all build artifacts.
